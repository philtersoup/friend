# Friend
Friend is a max for live device Iâ€™ve been developing over the last few months. Now with this 21 day lock down I had some time to sit down with it. 

This devices explores aleatoric composition techniques and adapts completely to your playing style. It works by understanding the pitch, dynamics, duration and repetition of the notes you play in and comes up with its own interpretation, evolutions and variations. No two cycles are the same, yet they sound similar. 

This is a very early version of my idea and is merely a proof of concept. 


This is monophonic at the moment in "Learn" mode, so play single notes, maybe across different octaves to get the best results. 


# Things to do

1. Have a tempo synced mode. Currently its in free tempo which it derives from the playing its great for just jamming, but having that would be cool too!  
2. Different modes and fine grain control of repeatibility and variations.
